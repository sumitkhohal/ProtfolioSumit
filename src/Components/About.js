          Hi,
          <br />
          My name is Sumit, and I am an Application Developer associate with a
          passion for coding and problem-solving. With proficiency in multiple
          programming languages and frameworks, I enjoy developing innovative
          solutions to complex software issues using various tools and
          techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an experienced developer, I am well-versed in all phases of the
          software development life cycle and have experience in Agile
          development techniques. I am always eager to learn and stay up-to-date
          with the latest software development trends, and I actively
          participate in code reviews on Github to provide and receive
          suggestions.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I am also a collaborative team
          player, working effectively in a team of seven and providing support
          to fellow team members. I have experience in developing REST APIs and
          have worked with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. I am
          also proficient in various web technologies, including React JS,
          Redux, React Routers, Hooks, GraphQL, Django, HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, I am a driven and enthusiastic developer who is always
          looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. I believe that
          software development is a constantly evolving field, and I am excited
          to be a part of it.
